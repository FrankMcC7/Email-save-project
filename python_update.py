That error typically happens on Windows systems since `grep` is a Unix/Linux command. Here's a Windows-compatible alternative:

```
pip list --outdated --format=freeze > outdated_packages.txt
for /F "tokens=1 delims==" %i in (outdated_packages.txt) do pip install -U %i
del outdated_packages.txt
```

Or you can use this one-liner which should work on Windows without requiring grep:

```
pip install --upgrade $(pip freeze | %{$_.split('==')[0]})
```

If you're using PowerShell, you can try:

```
pip list --outdated | Select-Object -Skip 2 | ForEach-Object { pip install --upgrade $_.Split()[0] }
```

Alternatively, you can use the Python package `pip-review` which is cross-platform:

```
pip install pip-review
pip-review --auto
```

This will install the pip-review tool and then use it to automatically update all outdated packages.
