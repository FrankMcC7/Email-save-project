Here are all the packages that need to be installed via terminal for the translation script to work:

```
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 python-docx PyPDF2 tqdm
```

Breaking down what each package does:

1. **googletrans==4.0.0-rc1** - The unofficial Google Translate API wrapper that handles language detection and translation
   - Note: The version number is important, as older versions may not work properly

2. **python-docx** - Used to read and extract text from Microsoft Word (.docx) files

3. **PyPDF2** - Used to read and extract text from PDF files

4. **tqdm** - Adds progress bars to show translation progress for larger documents

You can install all of these at once with the single command above. If you're using a virtual environment (recommended), make sure to activate it first before running the pip install command.
