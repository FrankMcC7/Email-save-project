Credit Escalation Process Enhancements

1. Core Ownership and Scope

The team now owns the end-to-end credit escalation process: sourcing, reporting, and escalating with CPOs (and team leads if needed).

This process is executed globally. ECAs serve as a point of escalation, but the primary responsibility remains with your team.

In EMEA, reach out to SRM/OCRMs directly when necessary.



2. Onshore Engagement and Reporting

Onshore regional teams are consulted to determine next steps for sticky funds.

Detailed reports of pending actions are circulated to CPOs/ECAs ahead of scheduled connects.



3. Improved Response Rates

Response rates from Credit Officers have increased, aided by data-driven conversations across all regions.
