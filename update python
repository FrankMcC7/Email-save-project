Let's fix that. First, you need to install pip-review:

```bash
pip install pip-review
```

If that doesn't work, try:
```bash
python -m pip install pip-review
```

If you're still getting the "not recognized" error, let's use the alternative method which works on all systems:

```bash
# First, see your outdated packages
pip list --outdated

# Then update all packages (for Windows)
pip freeze | %{$_.split('==')[0]} | %{pip install --upgrade $_}
```

Or you can do it in two simple steps:
```bash
# Step 1: Create a requirements file
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Step 2: Upgrade all packages from the requirements file
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

Are you getting any specific error messages? Let me know if you need help with any of these methods.
