   - Established robust risk data extraction methodology
   - Achieved 100% compliance with regulatory requirements
   - Created comprehensive training materials for future team expansion

Team Skills
Throughout 2024, I've consistently demonstrated strong leadership in managing cross-functional teams across multiple locations. The implementation of structured knowledge sharing sessions has significantly improved team capability and reduced dependency on key individuals. Our team has shown exceptional adaptability in handling new processes while maintaining high quality standards in BAU activities.

Compliance
Maintained 100% completion rate for all compliance requirements throughout 2024, including timely renewal of AIM certification and completion of additional regulatory training modules. Proactively participated in compliance enhancement initiatives and supported team members in maintaining their certifications.

2025 Objectives
Looking ahead, I aim to:
- Implement advanced automation solutions across all processes
- Develop comprehensive cross-training programs to enhance team flexibility
- Establish centers of excellence within each region
- Further enhance risk reporting capabilities through technology integration
- Focus on developing future team leaders through structured mentoring programs
